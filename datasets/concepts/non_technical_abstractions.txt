Here are abstract non-technical concepts that would be valuable and challenging for teaching AI:

Philosophy & Consciousness
Qualia and Subjective Experience - The "redness" of red, the "painfulness" of pain - irreducible first-person experiences.
The Ship of Theseus Problem - Identity persistence through change, applicable to personal identity, organizations, cultures.
Intentionality - How mental states can be "about" something, the directedness of consciousness.
Modal Reasoning - Necessity vs possibility, counterfactuals, "what could have been."
Phenomenology - The structures of experience itself, how consciousness constitutes meaning.

Social & Cultural Abstractions
Social Constructs vs Natural Kinds - Money, borders, gender roles as collective agreements rather than physical facts.
Cultural Relativism vs Universals - Which human behaviors/values are culturally specific vs universal.
Power Dynamics and Soft Power - Influence without force, how authority emerges and maintains itself.
Collective Memory and Mythology - How societies remember, forget, and construct shared narratives.
The Sacred and Profane - How cultures designate certain spaces, times, objects as set apart.

Aesthetic & Artistic Concepts
Negative Space - The importance of what's not there in art, music, design, and communication.
Aesthetic Distance - The psychological space needed to appreciate art vs being too close/involved.
The Uncanny Valley - Why almost-but-not-quite human things disturb us more than clearly non-human ones.
Kitsch vs Camp - Failed seriousness vs deliberate theatrical badness, and why the distinction matters.
Wabi-Sabi - Finding beauty in imperfection, impermanence, and incompleteness.

Language & Meaning
Pragmatics and Implicature - What's meant beyond what's literally said, Gricean maxims.
Metaphorical Thinking - How abstract concepts are grounded in physical experience (up=good, time=money).
Irony and Meta-levels - Saying one thing to mean another, and recursive irony (ironic appreciation of irony).
Speech Acts - How words do things (promises, declarations) not just describe things.
Deixis - Words whose meaning shifts with context (here, now, you, this).

Psychological Abstractions
Cognitive Dissonance - The discomfort of holding contradictory beliefs and how we resolve it.
Flow States - The dissolution of self-awareness during deep engagement.
Parasocial Relationships - One-sided emotional connections with fictional characters or celebrities.
The Hedonic Treadmill - Why happiness returns to baseline despite positive/negative events.
Emotional Granularity - The ability to distinguish subtle emotional states (frustration vs anger vs indignation).

Ethical & Moral Abstractions
Moral Luck - How circumstances beyond our control affect moral judgment.
The Is-Ought Problem - Why you can't derive moral prescriptions from factual descriptions.
Virtue Ethics vs Consequences - Character-based vs outcome-based moral reasoning.
Moral Intuitions vs Reasoning - Gut feelings about right/wrong vs logical ethical arguments.
Supererogation - Acts that are good but not obligatory (going beyond duty).

Unique Datasets/Approaches
Literary Close Reading Corpora - Expert annotations showing how subtle word choices create meaning.
Humor Dissection Datasets - Jokes explained (which kills them) to understand timing, expectation, social context.
Ethnographic Thick Descriptions - Rich cultural context around simple actions (Geertz's wink vs twitch).
Dream Logic Narratives - Stories that make sense by dream rules but not waking logic.
Therapeutic Dialogue Transcripts - How meaning emerges through interaction, not just content.
Art Criticism Through History - How the same artwork is interpreted differently across eras.
Ritual and Ceremony Descriptions - Actions that create meaning through performance, not utility.

Meta-Concepts
Liminality - Threshold states, being "betwixt and between" categories.
Dialectical Thinking - Thesis-antithesis-synthesis, how contradictions drive development.
Hermeneutic Circles - Understanding wholes through parts and parts through wholes.
Performativity - How describing something can make it true (self-fulfilling prophecies).
Apophatic Knowledge - Understanding through negation, knowing what something is not.

The challenge with these concepts is they often:

Resist precise definition
Depend heavily on context and interpretation
Involve subjective experience
Operate through ambiguity rather than despite it
Require understanding human embodiment and culture
