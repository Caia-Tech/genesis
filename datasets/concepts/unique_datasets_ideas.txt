Here are some unique datasets and alternative approaches for teaching abstract STEM concepts to AI:

Unique Datasets

Mathematical Proofs with Failed Attempts - Datasets showing not just correct proofs but the dead ends, false starts, and why certain approaches fail. Understanding "mathematical taste."

Code Refactoring Histories - Before/after snapshots of code improvements with explanations of why changes improve abstraction, maintainability, or elegance.

Scientific Paradigm Shifts - Historical data showing how theories evolved (geocentric → heliocentric, phlogiston → oxygen, etc.) to teach conceptual flexibility.

Ambiguous Specifications → Implementations - Dataset of vague requirements and multiple valid interpretations/implementations, teaching specification refinement.

Performance Anomaly Datasets - Code that behaves counterintuitively (cache misses, branch prediction failures) to teach hardware-software abstraction gaps.

Abstract Art → Mathematical Concepts - Mappings between visual patterns and mathematical structures (fractals, group theory, topology).

Novel Problem Domains

Program Synthesis from Analogies - "Make a sorting algorithm that works like organizing a bookshelf" - requiring cross-domain abstraction.

Constraint Satisfaction in Impossible Scenarios - Problems with no solution, teaching AI to recognize and explain why constraints are incompatible.

Emergent Behavior Prediction - Simple rules for cellular automata/agent systems and predicting qualitative outcomes.

Reverse Engineering Abstractions - Given multiple concrete implementations, derive the abstract interface or pattern they share.

Protocol Design Problems - Creating communication protocols for aliens with different mathematics/logic systems.

Interdisciplinary Challenges

Biological Algorithms - How DNA replication, protein folding, or neural development implement computational concepts.

Economic Mechanism Design - Creating market systems that incentivize truthfulness or efficiency, bridging CS and economics.

Music Theory as Formal Systems - Counterpoint rules, harmonic progressions as constraint systems and generative grammars.

Chemistry as Graph Algorithms - Reaction pathways, molecular similarity, and synthesis planning as graph problems.

Meta-Learning Concepts

Abstraction Ladder Climbing - Problems requiring recognizing when to move up/down abstraction levels.

Notation Design Challenges - Creating new notations for concepts (like how Leibniz notation revolutionized calculus).

Impossibility Proof Construction - Not just understanding but generating proofs of why something cannot be done.

Cross-Compilation Between Paradigms - Translating functional programs to imperative, logic programs to functional, etc.

Experimental Datasets

"Broken" Abstract Systems - Slightly wrong versions of mathematical systems (groups with almost-associativity) to test understanding.

Polyglot Programming Challenges - Same algorithm in radically different paradigms to separate concept from syntax.

Conceptual Debugging - Finding flaws in mathematical proofs, system designs, or abstract arguments.

Generalization Gradient Datasets - Series from very specific to very abstract (bubble sort → comparison sort → topological sort → partial order theory).

Interactive/Dynamic Datasets

Adversarial Abstraction Games - One agent creates edge cases, another must generalize their solution.

Socratic Dialogue Trees - Teaching through questions that guide discovery of abstract principles.

Abstraction Compression Challenges - Express complex systems in minimal formal languages.

Theory Building Simulations - Given observations, build increasingly general theories that explain them.

The key insight is that teaching abstraction isn't just about presenting abstract concepts, but about:

    The process of abstraction itself
    Recognizing when abstraction helps vs hurts
    Moving fluidly between abstraction levels
    Understanding the limits and failures of abstractions

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these dataset ideas or discuss how they might be structured for effective AI learning?
