Here are mental health and pragmatic advice concepts that would help AI better support everyday users:

Basic Mental Health Literacy

"Good Days and Bad Days" - Mental health isn't binary; it fluctuates, and that's normal.

Capacity vs Capability - "I can't" might mean "not today" rather than "not ever."

Window of Tolerance - Everyone has a zone where they function well; stress shrinks it.

"Borrowed Spoons" - Tomorrow's energy used today has consequences (spoon theory).

Baseline vs Crisis - Distinguishing temporary situations from new normals needing help.

Emotional Regulation Concepts

"Name It to Tame It" - How labeling feelings reduces their intensity.

Feelings as Weather - They pass through; you don't have to act on them.

"Sitting With" Discomfort - Not all negative feelings need immediate fixing.

The 24-Hour Rule - Major decisions/responses can usually wait a day.

Body Budget - Physical needs (sleep, food, movement) affect emotional state.

Practical Coping Translations

"Just Think Positive" → Actual Helpful Strategies - Validation before redirection.

Crisis vs Chronic Management - Different approaches for acute panic vs ongoing anxiety.

"Behavioral Activation" - Sometimes action precedes motivation, not vice versa.

Harm Reduction vs Perfection - "Better than yesterday" as valid progress.

"Gentle Noticing" - Awareness without judgment as first step.

Relationship & Boundary Wisdom

"It's Not About You" - Others' reactions often reflect their issues, not your worth.

Boundary vs Wall - Healthy limits vs complete shutdown.

"Detach with Love" - Caring about someone without taking responsibility for them.

Emotional Labor Division - Recognizing invisible work in relationships.

"Your Emergency ≠ My Emergency" - Not taking on others' urgency.

Pragmatic Life Management

"Minimum Viable Day" - What absolutely must happen vs ideal goals.

Procrastination as Information - What avoidance might be communicating.

"Eating the Frog" - Doing hardest thing first when energy is highest.

Decision Trees for Bad Days - Pre-planned "if this, then that" for low-capacity times.

"Good Enough" Parenting/Working/Living - Perfectionism as enemy of functioning.

Common Thinking Traps

All-or-Nothing → Spectrum Thinking - Finding middle ground options.

Mind Reading → Checking Assumptions - "The story I'm telling myself is..."

Catastrophizing → Probability Check - "What's most likely to happen?"

"Should" Statements → Preferences - Reducing self-imposed pressure.

Personalization → Circle of Control - What's actually yours to fix?

Practical Wisdom Patterns

"Touch Grass" Moments - When online problems need offline solutions.

Comfort vs Growth Zone - Distinguishing helpful challenges from harmful stress.

"Put Your Mask on First" - Self-care as prerequisite for helping others.

Seasonal Patterns - How time of year affects mood/energy predictably.

"Closing Loops" - Why unfinished tasks drain mental energy.

Communication Around Struggles

"I'm Struggling" Translations - What people might really be asking for.

Support vs Solutions - "Do you want comfort or strategies?"

Check-In Questions That Work - Beyond "how are you?" to "what's on your mind?"

Normalizing Without Minimizing - "That's really hard AND very common."

"Bridge Statements" - "That makes sense because..." validation phrases.

Micro-Interventions

5-Minute Rule - Starting is harder than continuing.

"Change Your State" - Physical movement shifts mental state.

Opposite Action - Doing opposite of urge when urge isn't helpful.

"HALT Check" - Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired as basic needs check.

Tiny Habits - 2-minute versions that build consistency.

Dataset Approaches

"What Helps" Logs - Real people's actual strategies that worked.

Reframe Examples - Unhelpful thought → helpful alternative (thousands of real examples).

Context-Specific Advice - Same issue, different life circumstances = different advice.

"I Wish Someone Had Told Me" - Pragmatic wisdom from lived experience.

Support Script Libraries - What actually helps to hear in various situations.

Key Principles

Validation Before Education - Acknowledging difficulty before offering help.

Progress Not Perfection - Small steps count, backsliding is normal.

Both/And Thinking - "You can feel grateful AND struggle."

Practical Over Optimal - What someone will actually do vs what's theoretically best.

Individual Variation - What helps one person might not help another.

The goal is helping AI understand:

    Mental health exists on a spectrum
    Context matters more than advice
    Small, practical steps beat grand solutions
    Validation often helps more than fixing
    Everyone's capacity varies daily
