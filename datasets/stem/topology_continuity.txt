What is a topological space? A topological space is a set with a collection of open sets satisfying certain axioms.
What are the axioms of a topology? The empty set and whole space are open, arbitrary unions of open sets are open, finite intersections are open.
What is a homeomorphism? A homeomorphism is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse, preserving topological properties.

What is a continuous function topologically? A function where preimages of open sets are open sets.
What is compactness in topology? A space where every open cover has a finite subcover.
Is the real line compact? No, the real line is not compact but closed bounded intervals are.
What is connectedness? A space that cannot be separated into two disjoint non-empty open sets.
What is path connectedness? A space where any two points can be joined by a continuous path.
Does path connected imply connected? Yes, but connected doesn't always imply path connected.
What is a manifold? A topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space.
What dimension is the surface of a sphere? The 2-sphere surface is a 2-dimensional manifold.
What is the fundamental group? The group of loops at a basepoint up to continuous deformation.
What is the fundamental group of a circle? The fundamental group of a circle is the integers Z.
What is a covering space? A space that maps onto another space in a locally homeomorphic way.
What is the Euler characteristic? A topological invariant, for polyhedra it's vertices minus edges plus faces.
What is the Euler characteristic of a sphere? The Euler characteristic of a sphere is 2.
What is a homotopy? A continuous deformation between two continuous functions.
Are homotopic spaces topologically equivalent? Homotopy equivalent spaces share many topological properties but aren't necessarily homeomorphic.
What is a metric space? A set with a distance function satisfying certain axioms.
Does every metric space have a topology? Yes, the metric induces a topology via open balls.
What is a Hausdorff space? A space where distinct points have disjoint neighborhoods.
What is the quotient topology? The finest topology making the quotient map continuous.
What is a topological invariant? A property preserved under homeomorphisms.
Is dimension a topological invariant? Yes, dimension is preserved under homeomorphisms.
What is the Brouwer fixed point theorem? Every continuous function from a disk to itself has a fixed point.
What is a deformation retract? A subspace that the whole space can be continuously shrunk onto.
What is the genus of a surface? The number of holes or handles in a surface.
What is a torus topologically? A torus is the product of two circles, having genus 1.
What is the Klein bottle? A non-orientable surface that cannot be embedded in 3D without self-intersection.
What is orientability? A property where a consistent choice of "clockwise" can be made everywhere.
Is a Möbius strip orientable? No, a Möbius strip is non-orientable with only one side.
What is a simplicial complex? A space built from simplices (triangles, tetrahedra) glued along faces.
What is homology? An algebraic way to count holes of different dimensions in a space.
What is the zeroth homology group? It counts the connected components of a space.
What is a contractible space? A space that can be continuously shrunk to a point.
Is a contractible space simply connected? Yes, contractible implies simply connected.
What is the Jordan curve theorem? A simple closed curve in the plane divides it into exactly two regions.
What is paracompactness? A space where every open cover has a locally finite refinement.
Are metric spaces paracompact? Yes, all metric spaces are paracompact.
What is the long line? A topological space longer than the real line but still one-dimensional.
What is a CW complex? A space built inductively by attaching cells of increasing dimension.
What is Urysohn's lemma? Normal spaces have enough continuous functions to separate closed sets.
What is the Tychonoff theorem? The product of compact spaces is compact in the product topology.
Can uncountable products be compact? Yes, by Tychonoff's theorem even uncountable products of compact spaces are compact.
What is sequential compactness? Every sequence has a convergent subsequence.
In metric spaces, is compactness equivalent to sequential compactness? Yes, in metric spaces these concepts coincide.
What is local compactness? Every point has a compact neighborhood.
Is the real line locally compact? Yes, every point has a compact interval neighborhood.
What is the one-point compactification? Adding a point at infinity to make a locally compact space compact.
