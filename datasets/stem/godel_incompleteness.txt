What is Gödel's first incompleteness theorem? Any consistent formal system containing arithmetic has true statements that cannot be proven within the system.
What is Gödel's second incompleteness theorem? No consistent system containing arithmetic can prove its own consistency.
What is a formal system? A formal system has axioms, inference rules, and a language for expressing statements.
What does completeness mean for a formal system? A system is complete if every true statement can be proven.
What does consistency mean? A system is consistent if it cannot prove both a statement and its negation.
What is Gödel numbering? A method of encoding formal statements as natural numbers.
How does Gödel numbering work? Each symbol gets a number, then sequences are encoded using prime factorization.
What is the diagonal lemma? For any property, there exists a statement saying "I have this property."
What is a Gödel sentence? A statement that essentially says "I am not provable in this system."
Is the Gödel sentence true or false? If the system is consistent, the Gödel sentence is true but unprovable.
What is the liar paradox? "This statement is false" - it cannot consistently be true or false.
How does Gödel avoid the liar paradox? Gödel uses "unprovable" instead of "false" to avoid direct paradox.
What is primitive recursion? Functions built from zero, successor, and recursion on natural numbers.
Why is primitive recursion important to Gödel? It shows that provability can be expressed arithmetically.
What is the halting problem? Determining whether a program halts is undecidable.
How does Gödel relate to the halting problem? Both show fundamental limitations of formal/computational systems.
What systems do Gödel's theorems apply to? Any system strong enough to express basic arithmetic.
Does Gödel apply to Euclidean geometry? Pure Euclidean geometry is complete, Gödel doesn't apply without arithmetic.
What is Peano arithmetic? A formal system for natural numbers with axioms for zero, successor, and induction.
Is Peano arithmetic complete? No, Gödel's theorem shows Peano arithmetic is incomplete.
What is ω-consistency? A system is ω-consistent if it doesn't prove both ∃xP(x) and ¬P(0), ¬P(1), ¬P(2)...
Is ω-consistency stronger than consistency? Yes, ω-consistency implies consistency but not vice versa.
What is Rosser's theorem? A strengthening showing incompleteness holds even without assuming ω-consistency.
Can we just add the Gödel sentence as an axiom? Yes, but then there's a new Gödel sentence for the extended system.
What is the arithmetical hierarchy? Classification of statements by quantifier complexity.
Where do Gödel sentences sit in the hierarchy? Gödel sentences can be constructed at the Π₁ level.
What is a decidable theory? A theory where an algorithm can determine provability of any statement.
Is arithmetic decidable? No, arithmetic is undecidable by Gödel's theorem.
What is Tarski's theorem? The set of true arithmetic statements cannot be defined in arithmetic.
How does Tarski relate to Gödel? Tarski shows truth is stronger than provability, complementing Gödel.
What is the provability predicate? A formula Prov(n) that holds when n encodes a provable statement.
What are the Hilbert-Bernays conditions? Conditions the provability predicate must satisfy for Gödel's proof.
What is Löb's theorem? If a system proves "if P is provable then P" then it proves P.
What is the fixed point theorem? For any formula φ(x), there exists a sentence G such that G ↔ φ(⌈G⌉).
Can inconsistent systems prove everything? Yes, from a contradiction anything follows (explosion principle).
What was Hilbert's program? An attempt to prove mathematics consistent using finitary methods.
How did Gödel affect Hilbert's program? Gödel showed Hilbert's program cannot succeed as originally conceived.
What is a sound formal system? A system where all provable statements are true.
Does soundness imply consistency? Yes, sound systems are consistent since they can't prove false statements.
What is second-order arithmetic? Arithmetic with quantification over sets of numbers, not just numbers.
Is second-order logic complete? No, second-order logic is incomplete by Gödel's theorem.
What is the completeness theorem? First-order logic is complete: all valid statements are provable.
Is Gödel's completeness theorem related to incompleteness? They're different: completeness is about logic, incompleteness about arithmetic.
What is essential incompleteness? A theory that remains incomplete under any recursive extension.
Are there natural independent statements? Yes, like the continuum hypothesis and large cardinal axioms.
What is the Paris-Harrington theorem? A natural combinatorial statement independent of Peano arithmetic.
Can computers overcome Gödel's limits? No, computers are formal systems subject to the same limitations.
What is a Turing machine? An abstract model of computation with tape, states, and rules.
How do Turing machines relate to Gödel? Both show fundamental limits: uncomputability mirrors incompleteness.
