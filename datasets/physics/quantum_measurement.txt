What is the measurement problem? How and why does quantum superposition collapse to definite outcomes?
What is superposition? Quantum systems exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.
What happens during measurement? Wave function appears to instantly collapse to single eigenstate.
What is wave function collapse? Transition from superposition to definite state upon observation.
Does consciousness cause collapse? Debated - some interpretations say yes, others find physical causes.
What is the Copenhagen interpretation? Measurement causes collapse; don't ask what happens between measurements.
What is many-worlds interpretation? No collapse - all outcomes happen in parallel universes.
What is decoherence? Environmental interaction causes apparent collapse without true collapse.
Can we see superposition directly? No - measurement always finds definite states, never superpositions.
What is Schr√∂dinger's cat? Thought experiment showing absurdity of macroscopic superposition.
Is the cat really alive and dead? Illustrates measurement problem - when does superposition end?
What is the Heisenberg cut? Arbitrary boundary between quantum system and classical observer.
Where do we place the cut? No consensus - could be particle, detector, or conscious observer.
What makes measurement special? Seemingly violates unitary evolution of quantum mechanics.
What is the projection postulate? Upon measurement, system projects onto eigenstate of observable.
Is collapse instantaneous? Appears to be, raising questions about relativity and locality.
What is objective collapse theory? Physical theories where collapse happens spontaneously at certain scales.
What is the quantum Zeno effect? Frequent measurements can freeze quantum evolution.
Can we measure without disturbing? No - measurement necessarily disturbs quantum systems.
What is weak measurement? Gentle measurements that minimally disturb while gaining limited information.
What is the delayed choice experiment? Shows measurement choice can seemingly affect past behavior.
What is quantum erasure? Erasing which-path information can restore interference after the fact.
What is the quantum-classical boundary? Where quantum behavior transitions to classical - no sharp line.
Do all interactions cause collapse? No - only certain interactions count as measurements.
What makes an interaction a measurement? Must create lasting record in environment or apparatus.
What is the preferred basis problem? Why does collapse happen in position basis, not superpositions?
What is quantum Darwinism? Environment selects certain states as "fittest" to survive and be observed.
Can consciousness be measured? Unknown - the hard problem meets quantum measurement problem.
What is von Neumann chain? Measurement devices are quantum too - where does chain end?
What is participatory universe? Wheeler's idea that observation creates reality retroactively.
Do measurements create reality? Depends on interpretation - some say yes, others say reveal.
What is contextuality? Measurement outcomes depend on what else you measure.
Can we undo measurement? Generally no - measurement creates irreversible entanglement.
What is the measurement basis? The specific property being measured determines possible outcomes.
Why probabilistic outcomes? Quantum mechanics only predicts probabilities, not definite results.
What is Born rule? Probability equals amplitude squared - but why this rule?
Is measurement continuous or discrete? Appears discrete but might be rapid continuous process.
What is quantum feedback? Using measurement results to control quantum systems.
Can we watch wave function collapse? Some experiments claim to see continuous collapse process.
What is protective measurement? Theoretical way to measure wave function without collapse.
Do all interpretations agree on predictions? Yes - they differ on what happens, not what we observe.
What is the information interpretation? Measurement is fundamentally about information gain.
Can measurement happen without observers? Yes in most interpretations - environment can measure.
What is the relational interpretation? Properties only exist relative to observers, not absolutely.
Why does measurement seem irreversible? Creates entanglement with large environment - practically irreversible.
What is quantum nondemolition? Measurement that doesn't destroy the measured quantity.
Can AI solve measurement problem? Would need to understand consciousness first.
Is measurement problem solved? No - remains central mystery of quantum mechanics.
Why care about measurement problem? Fundamental to understanding reality's nature.
