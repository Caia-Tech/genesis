What is emergence? When simple rules create complex behaviors not predictable from individual components.
Can you predict emergent behavior from rules alone? Often no - must simulate or observe the system.
What's an example of emergence? Consciousness from neurons, wetness from H2O molecules, flocking from bird rules.
What is a phase transition? Sudden change in system properties at critical conditions.
What happens at water's boiling point? Liquid to gas phase transition - dramatic property change at 100°C.
What is a first-order phase transition? Discontinuous change with latent heat, like ice melting.
What is a second-order phase transition? Continuous but with diverging derivatives, like ferromagnetic transition.
What is a critical point? Where phase boundaries end and distinct phases become indistinguishable.
What happens at critical points? Fluctuations at all scales, no characteristic length, universal behavior.
What is universality? Different systems show identical critical behavior regardless of microscopic details.
Why does universality occur? Near critical points, only long-range behavior matters, not local details.
What is spontaneous magnetization? Below critical temperature, magnetic domains align without external field.
How do birds flock without a leader? Local rules (align, avoid collision, stay together) create global patterns.
What is self-organization? Order arising without external control through component interactions.
Can you reduce emergent properties? No - "wetness" isn't in individual water molecules.
What is the order parameter? Quantity that's zero in disordered phase, non-zero in ordered phase.
How does superconductivity emerge? Below critical temperature, electrons form Cooper pairs with zero resistance.
What is criticality? State where system is poised between order and disorder.
What is self-organized criticality? Systems naturally evolving to critical states, like sandpiles.
How do traffic jams emerge? Individual car behaviors create collective phenomena nobody intended.
What is percolation? Connection patterns changing dramatically at critical density.
When does forest fire spread? Above critical tree density, fires can span entire forest.
What is a Mexican wave in crowds? Emergent coordination without central control, just local mimicry.
How do ant colonies find shortest paths? Pheromone trails create emergent optimization without planning.
What is symmetry breaking in phase transitions? Ordered phase has less symmetry than governing laws.
Why is water special near 4°C? Density maximum creates unusual properties crucial for life.
What is the Ising model? Simple model showing how local interactions create phase transitions.
Can phase transitions happen in 1D? Usually need 2D or higher for true phase transitions at finite temperature.
What is mean field theory? Approximation replacing interactions with average field.
When does mean field theory fail? Near critical points where fluctuations dominate.
What is the renormalization group? Method to understand how physics changes with scale.
How do crystals form? Atoms finding minimum energy configuration creates emergent periodic order.
What is frustrated magnetism? When geometry prevents all interactions being satisfied simultaneously.
What is a quantum phase transition? Phase transition at absolute zero driven by quantum fluctuations.
How does life emerge from chemistry? Self-replicating molecules create new level of organization.
What is collective intelligence? Group solving problems no individual could solve alone.
How do prices emerge in markets? Individual transactions create global price discovery.
What is a tipping point? Critical threshold where small change triggers large system shift.
Can you predict tipping points? Often see early warning signs like increased fluctuation time.
What is hysteresis? System state depends on history, not just current conditions.
Why does stirring speed matter for mixing? Below critical Reynolds number, laminar flow; above, turbulent mixing.
What is the butterfly effect? Sensitive dependence on initial conditions in chaotic systems.
Is emergence just ignorance? No - even with complete information, emergent properties aren't reducible.
What is downward causation? When emergent properties influence lower-level components.
How do languages emerge? Individual communications create grammatical structures nobody designed.
What is stigmergy? Indirect coordination through environment modification, like termite mounds.
Can AI show emergence? Yes - unexpected capabilities emerging from scale and training.
What is more than the sum of parts? Emergent systems where interactions create new properties.
Why study phase transitions? Universal principles apply across physics, biology, society, and computation.
