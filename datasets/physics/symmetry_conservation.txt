What is Noether's theorem? Every continuous symmetry in physics corresponds to a conserved quantity.
What symmetry gives conservation of energy? Time translation symmetry - laws of physics don't change over time.
What symmetry gives conservation of momentum? Spatial translation symmetry - physics same everywhere in space.
What symmetry gives conservation of angular momentum? Rotational symmetry - physics same in all directions.
What is gauge symmetry? Transformations that leave physics unchanged, like phase shifts in quantum mechanics.
Why are conservation laws fundamental? They constrain what transitions are possible in any physical process.
What is CPT symmetry? Combined symmetry of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal.
Has any symmetry violation been observed? Yes, parity violation in weak interactions shocked physicists.
What is spontaneous symmetry breaking? System's state has less symmetry than its governing laws.
How does a pencil standing on tip break symmetry? Falls in random direction though all directions equally likely.
What is the Higgs mechanism? Spontaneous symmetry breaking that gives particles mass.
What symmetry does crystallization break? Continuous translational symmetry becomes discrete lattice symmetry.
What is a global symmetry? Same transformation applied everywhere at once.
What is a local symmetry? Transformation can vary from point to point in spacetime.
Why are local symmetries special? They require gauge fields and lead to fundamental forces.
What symmetry gives electric charge conservation? U(1) gauge symmetry of electromagnetism.
What is translation invariance? Physics works the same way at all locations.
What is rotational invariance? Physics works the same in all orientations.
What is Lorentz invariance? Physics same in all inertial reference frames.
What breaks Lorentz symmetry? Nothing observed yet - it's a fundamental spacetime symmetry.
What is time reversal symmetry? Laws work the same running forward or backward in time.
Where is time reversal broken? In weak interactions and the second law of thermodynamics.
What is parity symmetry? Mirror reflection - flipping all spatial coordinates.
Why was parity violation shocking? Everyone assumed nature didn't have handedness preference.
What is charge conjugation? Swapping particles with antiparticles.
What is supersymmetry? Proposed symmetry between fermions and bosons.
Has supersymmetry been found? Not yet - would require superpartner particles.
What is scale invariance? Physics looks the same at all length scales.
Where does scale invariance appear? At critical points and phase transitions.
What is conformal symmetry? Preserves angles but not necessarily distances.
What conserved quantity comes from gauge symmetry? The gauge charge like electric charge or color charge.
What is a symmetry group? Mathematical group describing all symmetry transformations.
What is SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1)? The gauge symmetry group of the Standard Model.
What happens when symmetry is approximate? Conservation law is approximate - quantity slowly changes.
What is explicit symmetry breaking? When symmetry is broken by external conditions.
What is a Ward identity? Relation between correlation functions following from symmetry.
What is Goldstone's theorem? Spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetry creates massless bosons.
Why do we seek symmetries? They simplify problems and reveal deep structure.
What symmetry explains identical particles? Permutation symmetry - swapping identical particles changes nothing.
What is the symmetry of empty space? Full Poincaré symmetry - translations, rotations, boosts.
Can symmetries emerge? Yes, effective symmetries can appear at certain scales.
What is dynamical symmetry breaking? Symmetry broken by dynamics rather than fundamental laws.
What protects conservation laws? Symmetries - can't violate conservation without breaking symmetry.
What is holographic symmetry? Proposed equivalence between bulk and boundary theories.
Are all symmetries fundamental? Some are emergent or approximate at certain scales.
What is discrete symmetry? Symmetry under discrete transformations like reflection.
What is continuous symmetry? Symmetry under continuous transformations like rotation.
How do symmetries guide physics? Constraining theories and predicting new phenomena.
What is the role of broken symmetry? Creates diversity and structure in the universe.
