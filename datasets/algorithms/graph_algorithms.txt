When is topological sort possible? Only in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
What is Kahn's algorithm? Kahn's algorithm does topological sort using in-degree counts.
What is a maximum flow? The maximum amount that can flow from source to sink.
What is the Ford-Fulkerson method? Ford-Fulkerson finds max flow by repeatedly finding augmenting paths.
What is the Edmonds-Karp algorithm? Edmonds-Karp is Ford-Fulkerson using BFS for O(VE²) complexity.
What is the max-flow min-cut theorem? Maximum flow equals minimum cut capacity.
