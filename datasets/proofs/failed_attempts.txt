What's a common failed approach to proving √2 is irrational? Trying decimal expansion - you can't prove irrationality by computing digits, no matter how many.
Why does decimal expansion fail for irrationality proofs? Irrationals have infinite non-repeating decimals, but you can't check infinite digits.
What's the successful approach to prove √2 is irrational? Assume √2 = p/q in lowest terms, show both p and q must be even, contradicting lowest terms.
Why might someone try induction to prove Cantor's theorem? Sets seem countable by size, but induction only works on natural numbers, not arbitrary cardinalities.
What's wrong with trying to list all real numbers? Any list misses numbers - Cantor's diagonal shows how to construct a missing real from any list.
Why can't we prove Fermat's Last Theorem by checking cases? Infinite cases exist; checking finitely many proves nothing about the rest.
What's a failed approach to the Four Color Theorem? Trying general theoretical proof - succeeded only after computer-checking thousands of cases.
Why doesn't picture-drawing prove geometric theorems? Pictures show specific cases, not general truth; optical illusions can deceive.
What's wrong with proving 0.999... ≠ 1 by intuition? Intuition says there's a gap, but rigorous analysis shows they're equal.
Why do people wrongly think they've solved P vs NP? They often reduce NP to P with exponential hidden costs or miss subtle complexity.
What's a common error in Goldbach conjecture attempts? Showing it holds for many cases or finding patterns - doesn't prove it for all evens.
Why can't we prove axiom independence by finding models? You need models both with and without the axiom to prove independence.
What's wrong with proving continuity by checking many points? Continuity requires checking all points; pathological functions can be discontinuous at rationals only.
Why do trisection attempts using ruler and compass fail? It's provably impossible - requires solving cubic equations, which ruler/compass can't do.
What's the error in "proving" 1 = 2 by algebra? Hidden division by zero - when you have (a-b), you can't divide by it if a = b.
Why doesn't showing many derivatives exist prove smoothness? Functions can have all derivatives at a point but not be smooth (not Taylor series).
What's wrong with proving theorems by computer calculation? Numerical errors accumulate; theoretical proof needed for certainty.
Why can't we prove Collatz conjecture by testing numbers? No matter how many numbers reach 1, infinite numbers remain untested.
What fails when trying to prove Banach-Tarski with intuition? Volume seems conserved, but non-measurable sets break intuition about size.
Why do naive attempts at Continuum Hypothesis fail? People try to construct bijections, but CH is independent of ZFC.
What's wrong with proving all groups are abelian by examples? Counterexample exists - even small groups like S₃ are non-abelian.
Why can't pictures prove the Jordan Curve Theorem? Weird curves exist; rigorous proof needs careful topological arguments.
What's the flaw in proving Monty Hall by symmetry? The symmetry breaks when host opens a door with knowledge.
Why do people wrongly think 0^0 = 0? They apply x^0 = 1 incorrectly; 0^0 is actually indeterminate in analysis.
What's wrong with proving infinite series converge by partial sums? Partial sums can grow slowly but still diverge (harmonic series).
Why doesn't L'Hôpital's rule always work? Requires checking conditions; can give wrong answer if blindly applied.
What fails in geometric proofs assuming figures exist? Some constructions are impossible; existence needs proof.
Why can't we prove Riemann Hypothesis by checking zeros? Infinite zeros exist; computational checks can't cover all.
What's the issue with proving statements by contradiction carelessly? Must track assumptions carefully; easy to assume what you're proving.
Why do attempts to prove Axiom of Choice often fail? It's independent; people try constructive proofs but AC is non-constructive.
What goes wrong trying to prove Pythagorean theorem algebraically only? Miss geometric insight; multiple proofs give different understanding.
Why can't we prove results about infinite sets by finite analogy? Infinite sets have counterintuitive properties (Hilbert's hotel).
What's wrong with proving uniqueness by finding one solution? Must show no others exist; uniqueness is separate from existence.
Why do people fail proving irrationals are uncountable? Try to use countability arguments that work for rationals but not reals.
What's the error in "all functions are continuous" proofs? Confusing intuitive notion with rigorous epsilon-delta definition.
Why doesn't proving theorem for rationals extend to reals? Reals have different structure; density isn't completeness.
What fails when proving by "obvious" pattern matching? Patterns can break; sporadic groups show not all patterns continue.
Why can't we prove Fundamental Theorem of Algebra purely algebraically? Need analytical or topological methods; pure algebra insufficient.
What's wrong with circular proofs using the conclusion? Assuming what you want to prove makes any statement "provable."
Why do probabilistic primality proofs differ from deterministic? Probable prime might be composite; certainty needs different methods.
What's the issue with proving infinity equals infinity plus one? Different infinite cardinalities exist; need precise definitions.
Why doesn't strong induction prove false statements? Requires base case; without it, can "prove" anything.
What fails in proofs ignoring edge cases? Edge cases often break general arguments; completeness requires all cases.
Why can't we prove 3D rotation commutativity by examples? Rotations don't commute; gimbal lock shows order matters.
What's wrong with proving limits by getting close? Epsilon-delta requires working for any epsilon, not just small ones.
Why do fixed-point theorem proofs need continuity? Discontinuous functions can avoid fixed points even on closed intervals.
What's the error in proving all matrices have eigenvalues over reals? Need complex numbers; real matrices might have complex eigenvalues.
Why can't we prove infinite products converge like series? Different convergence conditions; product of terms near 1 can diverge.
What fails when trying to generalize from finite to infinite? Finite intuition breaks; compactness, choice depend on finiteness.
Why doesn't every "proof by picture" work in higher dimensions? Can't visualize 4D; rigorous algebra needed beyond 3D.
