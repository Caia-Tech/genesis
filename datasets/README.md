## Design Philosophy

These datasets teach gaia:
- Abstract reasoning beyond mere facts
- Human experience and practical wisdom
- Why approaches fail, not just what works
- Context-dependent understanding
- Nuanced social and emotional intelligence

## Usage

Each dataset contains Q&A pairs in the format:
```
Question? Answer explaining the concept.
```

Gaia learns patterns from these exchanges to generate coherent responses using only logic gates - no neural networks required.

## Contributing

When adding new datasets:
1. Use clear Q&A format
2. Focus on teaching concepts, not just facts
3. Include why things work or don't work
4. Add practical, real-world applications
5. Maintain attribution to Caia Tech
