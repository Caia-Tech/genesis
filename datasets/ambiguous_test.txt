The bank is near the river. The bank holds money. The bank provides loans.
Light travels fast. Light weighs nothing. Light illuminates darkness.
The spring brings flowers. The spring is coiled. The spring flows water.
Time flies quickly. Time heals wounds. Time waits for nobody.
The wave crashed loudly. The wave carried surfers. The wave of enthusiasm.
