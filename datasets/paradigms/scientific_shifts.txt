What was the geocentric model? Earth at the center of the universe with everything revolving around it.
What replaced geocentrism? The heliocentric model placing the sun at the center of the solar system.
Why was geocentrism compelling? It matched daily observations - sun appears to move across sky.
What evidence challenged geocentrism? Retrograde motion of planets, phases of Venus, Jupiter's moons.
How did defenders explain retrograde motion? Complex epicycles - circles moving on circles.
What made heliocentrism simpler? Retrograde motion naturally explained by Earth passing outer planets.
What was phlogiston theory? Combustible materials contain phlogiston released during burning.
What replaced phlogiston? Oxygen theory - burning combines material with oxygen from air.
Why did phlogiston seem logical? Burning materials lose mass (seemingly), flames rise up.
What killed phlogiston theory? Some metals gain weight when burned, opposite of prediction.
What was the luminiferous aether? Invisible medium through which light waves propagate.
What replaced aether? Special relativity - light needs no medium, space-time is the framework.
Why did scientists assume aether? All known waves needed a medium (sound needs air, water waves need water).
What experiment challenged aether? Michelson-Morley found no aether wind as Earth moves through it.
What was caloric theory? Heat as invisible fluid flowing from hot to cold objects.
What replaced caloric? Kinetic theory - heat is molecular motion, not a substance.
Why was caloric appealing? Heat seems to flow like water, can be stored and transferred.
What observations challenged caloric? Mechanical work generates heat (friction), suggesting motion connection.
What was spontaneous generation? Living organisms arise from non-living matter spontaneously.
What replaced it? Biogenesis - life only comes from existing life.
Why believe spontaneous generation? Maggots appear on meat, microbes in broth seemingly from nowhere.
What experiments refuted it? Pasteur's swan-neck flasks showed microbes came from air, not spontaneously.
What was the static universe model? Universe eternal and unchanging on large scales.
What replaced the static universe? Big Bang theory - universe expanding from initial singularity.
Why assume static universe? Night sky looks the same across centuries, philosophical preference for eternal.
What evidence changed this view? Hubble's redshift observations showing galaxies receding.
What was Lamarckian evolution? Acquired characteristics during life inherited by offspring.
What replaced Lamarckism? Darwinian natural selection acting on random variations.
Why was Lamarckism intuitive? Blacksmith's children seem strong, practiced skills seem heritable.
What evidence favored Darwin? Variations are random, acquired traits (like amputations) not inherited.
What was the plum pudding atomic model? Positive charge spread evenly with electrons embedded like raisins.
What replaced plum pudding? Nuclear model - tiny dense nucleus with orbiting electrons.
Why plum pudding seemed reasonable? Atoms are neutral, components must be evenly distributed.
What experiment changed this? Rutherford's gold foil - some particles bounced back, implying dense core.
What was vitalism? Living things contain special vital force distinct from chemistry.
What replaced vitalism? Biochemistry - life processes are complex chemistry, no special force.
Why believe in vitalism? Life seems fundamentally different from non-living matter.
What undermined vitalism? Synthesis of organic compounds (urea) from inorganic materials.
What was the steady state theory? Universe constantly creating matter to maintain constant density.
What supported Big Bang instead? Cosmic microwave background radiation, primordial element abundances.
What was catastrophism? Earth's features formed by sudden, violent events.
What replaced it? Uniformitarianism - slow, gradual processes over vast time.
Why catastrophism seemed obvious? Mountain ranges, canyons seem to require dramatic formation.
What evidence supported gradualism? Current erosion rates could carve canyons given millions of years.
What was preformationism? Organisms develop from miniature versions already formed.
What replaced it? Epigenesis - organisms develop gradually from undifferentiated material.
Why believe preformationism? Development seems too complex to arise from simple beginnings.
What showed epigenesis correct? Microscopy revealed embryos start simple, complexity emerges.
What was absolute time and space? Newton's fixed stage independent of matter and motion.
What replaced absolute space-time? Einstein's relative space-time affected by matter and energy.
Why was absolute space-time intuitive? Matches everyday experience at human scales and speeds.
What required relativity? Speed of light constant for all observers, Mercury's orbit precision.
