Update- July 28, 2025 - The next evolution: https://github.com/Caia-Tech/volcano-llm


⚠️ hitting fundamental walls, preserved for evidence and research - AFDP and Git forensics remain truly innovative. Still continuing in other directions.

FINDINGS- The Elixir program (not on Git) showed that different number bases make certain operations easier or harder - binary handles XOR efficiently, 
quaternary maps naturally to DNA operations, but ternary needs more gates for AND. Evolution found common patterns like NOT chains and Memory-XOR loops,
which we can optimize with JIT compilation. The main value is for specialized tasks like DNA processing, not general computing.

Can someone at least try [gaia](https://github.com/Caia-Tech/gaia) with scaled GPUs? Please. To publish research on the patterns
