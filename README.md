⚠️ hitting fundamental walls, preserved for evidence and research - AFDP and Git forensics remain truly innovative. Still continuing in other directions.

FINDINGS- The Elixir program (not on Git) showed that different number bases make certain operations easier or harder - binary handles XOR efficiently, 
quaternary maps naturally to DNA operations, but ternary needs more gates for AND. Evolution found common patterns like NOT chains and Memory-XOR loops,
which we can optimize with JIT compilation. The main value is for specialized tasks like DNA processing, not general computing.
